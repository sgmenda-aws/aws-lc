# PQ/T Hybrid KEMs

The source code in this folder implements post-quantum/traditional hybrid KEMs as defined in [DESIGN.md](./DESIGN.md).

NOTE: THIS IS AN IMPLEMENTATION OF A DRAFT, NOT A FINAL STANDARD.

## Usage

These KEMs implement the standard KEM API, see [crypto/kem/README.md](../kem/README.md).

## KATs and Testing

FIXME(sanketh): Adding KATs after updating the deterministic NISTP key generation to be FIPS compliant.
